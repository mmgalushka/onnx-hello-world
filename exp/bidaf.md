# Experiment with Bidirectional Attention Flow Model

To run experiments with the [BiDAF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01603) query/answer NLP model use [onnx_bidaf.ipynb](../onnx_bidaf.ipynb) notebook.

## Dataset

For performing this experiment, we will use some random contexts and queries.

## Prediction Results

### Simple Context

Here we used small context sentences and unique queries to each of them.

| Context | Query | Answer |
| --------| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| A red Tesla is parked beside my house. | What color is the car? | 'red' |
| More human twins are being born now than ever before. | Who are born now? | Who are born now? |
| The first person convicted of speeding was going eight mph. | What speed was doing the first convicted person for speeding? | 'eight', 'mph' |
| The world wastes about 1 billion metric tons of food each year. | How much food we waste? | '1', 'billion', 'metric', 'tons' |
| Pineapple works as a natural meat tenderizer. | What is a meat tenderizer? | 'pineapple' |

### Complex Context

Here we used big context text and few queries regarding it.

> Specifically, the hottest spot ever recorded on Earth is El Azizia, in Libya, where a temperature of 136 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded on Sept. 13, 1922. While hotter spots have likely occurred in other parts of the planet at other times, this is the most scorching temperature ever formally recorded by a weather station.

| Query | Answer |
| ----- | ------ |
| Where the hottest spot on Earth? | 'el', 'azizia' |
| Where is El Azizia? | 'libya' |
| What temperature has been detected? | '136', 'degrees', 'fahrenheit' |
| When this temperature has been recorded? | 'sept.', '13', ',', '1922' |
| By which station it was recorded? | 'weather', 'station' |

## Summary

To set up the BiDAF NLP model for inference was relatively easy. The author provided the preprocessor function. To process the model output we followed the documentation and few examples (found on the internet). Predictions generated by this model are good and can be easily applied for creating some kind of chatbot.
